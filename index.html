            <h3>Study Spaces</h3>
            <p>Even with effective time management, if the time allocated to
              studies is not used effectively, then then all the benefits of
              time management may not be seen. Appropriate places to study
              need to be established to ensure the time spent studying is
              effective.
            </p>
            <p>A study space is an environment in which studies can be
              entirely focused on and can be done with little or no
              distractions. This may be a study area in the household,
              an empty room, or anywhere that the above conditions are met.
              While there are some that are most comfortably used like a
              bedroom, this can be distracting as the room is associated
              with sleep, or a place where leisure activities are conducted.
              This can lead distractions while studying and many do not
              realize this would not constitute as a suitable study space.

          <div class="content2">
            <h3>Organization</h3>
            <p>Time is not the only asset that needs to be organized. Making
              sure that the tools needed are always available will ensure
              that every situation is prepared for. Having a pen and paper
              or a laptop to take notes, having a ruler for graphs, or
              having the right program installed for the specific task
              is ensuring that the proper materials are available to
              effectively study. This applies to other aspects as well.
              Transport to intended destinations, or a plan for what
              material to study are prime examples of keeping organized.
            </p>
            <p>Keeping on top of all tasks and getting all preparations
              organized beforehand will help in being prepared for
              any situation.

            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>By keeping a managed schedule of all activities and allocating
              time towards each effectively, it can lead help balance life
              activities while also achieving desired goals. By learning how
              to break down time effectively as shown in the next page,
              it will help achieve the many benefits of effective
              time management.
